this day:
I finish input-part(it seems) with shb, and re-optimized the system architecture, making input.h and input.c.

8.24:
i found wrong about ghdr...so I need to change mang thing....good luck

8.25:
I rewrite mang functions, and now it can ruan successfully without 1609.4
so I decided to write geo_input.c about more packet.
but there are still something to do......
a) the value and form of return
b) see the include/linux/netdevice.h  according to Makefile path
